# TimeSeries_Sarima_Arima

## Overview
This mini project focuses on the implementation of ARIMA and SARIMA models for Time Series analysis. We also visualize the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) for the same Time Series data.

## Key Features
- ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling
- SARIMA (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) modeling
- GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) plotting
- Time Series data analysis

## Dependencies
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to analyze the Time Series data using ARIMA and SARIMA models.
4. Visualize GARCH plots for volatility analysis.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains the Time Series data files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for analysis.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for running the analysis.
- `results/`: Store the results and plots.
